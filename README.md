# Jekyll Blogging Freelancer

Blogging Freelancer is a fork of [Freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer), a theme by Start Bootstrap. Apart from the single page template it provides a blog section, that I felt was missing in the original template. Everything is prepared for content-publishing using Jekyll.
