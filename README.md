# [Jekyll Blogging Freelancer](https://mewa.github.io/jekyll-blogging-freelancer/)

Blogging Freelancer is a fork of [Freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer), a theme by Start Bootstrap. Apart from the single page template it provides a blog section, that I felt was missing in the original template. Everything is prepared for content-publishing using Jekyll. 

# Getting started
This repository contains all the neccessary stuff to build a jekyll project from scratch. 

However, if you are not going to make any customizations to it instead of building from scratch you might consider cloning a Jekyll-ready package available on `gh-pages` branch. 

Or just download the zip over [here](https://github.com/mewa/jekyll-blogging-freelancer/archive/gh-pages.zip)

Otherwise proceed and clone or fork this repository using 
`git clone https://github.com/mewa/jekyll-blogging-freelancer.git`

#### Setup required gems

`bundle install`

#### Install dependencies

`npm install`

#### Build template

`gulp`

or get a live preview during development

`gulp dev`

# Customization

Javascript sources are under `src/js`
Sass sources are under `src/sass` directory.

Jekyll resources such as posts or portfolio items are under `res` in their respective directories.
